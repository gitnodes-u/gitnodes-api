# gitnodes-api
The gitnodes-api repository is a public, open-source project that provides a Node.js backend server for the GitNodes ecosystem. This server acts as an intermediary between GitNodes users and their GitHub repositories, enabling users to modify their repositories through the GitNodes Agent GitHub App.

The gitnodes-api repository contains the source code for a Node.js application built with Express.js, which serves as a robust, scalable, and modular API for processing and managing requests from GitNodes users. It integrates with the GitNodes Agent GitHub App to create branches, pull requests, and perform other necessary tasks on behalf of users.

Some key features of the gitnodes-api repository include:

1. Secure authentication: The API incorporates best practices for securely authenticating users, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify their GitNodes repositories.

2. Input validation: The API leverages libraries and best practices to validate user input, preventing potential security vulnerabilities and ensuring data integrity.

3. Rate limiting and throttling: The API includes mechanisms to manage the rate of incoming requests, preventing abuse and ensuring fair access to resources.

4. Error handling and logging: The API is designed to handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful feedback to users and logging information for debugging and monitoring purposes.

5. Extensibility: The modular design of the API allows for easy integration with additional services, libraries, and tools as the GitNodes ecosystem evolves.

The gitnodes-api repository is designed to be transparent and open to contributions from the community, allowing developers to collaborate on improvements, bug fixes, and new features, while ensuring the security and stability of the backend server.
